## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Phase bootstrap]: Run brownfield stabilization-first roadmap before feature expansion
- [21-03]: Bundled compound commits (T1+T2 / T3+T4 / T5+T6+T7) to keep HEAD compilable across Repository interface migrations
- [21-03]: Migrated outside-scope callers (bulkimport + sale) under Rule 3 (Blocking) — required for full project build

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 6 added: Cash Register Close Module — Cierre de Caja diario por asesor
- Phase 6 marked complete: 2026-04-14
- Phase 15 added: Mobile & Responsive Design — App funcione correctamente en PC, tablet y teléfono
- Phase 22 added: Comprehensive Test Coverage — unit + integration tests across Go backend (services, repositories, HTTP handlers) and React frontend (components, hooks, services) to lock current behavior and prevent regressions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Brownfield codebase has many active in-flight changes; phase execution should stay incremental and verification-heavy.
